> ### [Rust] + [Yew] + [WebAssembly] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld] spec and API.


### [Demo]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld]


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged [WebAssembly] web application built with [Yew] including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Yew] community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld] repo.

# How it works

This is an application written in [Rust] that utilizes [Yew] and [WebAssembly] for developing the frontend web app that powers the RealWorld application.

You can view a full list of crates being used in [Cargo.toml], but here are some of the main ones of note:

* [yew] - a modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded frontend apps with WebAssembly.
* [yew-router] - a routing library for the [Yew] framework.
* [lazy_static] - a macro for declaring lazily evaluated statics in Rust.
* [parking_lot] - provides implementations of `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `Condvar` and `Once` etc.
* [pulldown-cmark] - a pull parser for CommonMark, used to parse Markdown.
* [serde] - a generic serialization/deserialization framework.
* [chrono] - date and time library for Rust.

# Getting started

* Install [Rust]
* Install [wasm-pack]
  ```
  cargo install wasm-pack
  ```
* Install [node]
* Install npm packages
  ```
  npm run install
  ```
* Build and develop

  Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, and you can change the environment variables if you like.
  ```
  cp .env.example .env
  npm start
  ```
  You can visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser now.
* Build and release
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
  You should find static files at `crates/conduit-wasm/dist` folder now, they are hosted in [gh-pages] branch as a demo.

* Build and develop for desktop

  If you're planning on targeting Linux you must ensure that Webkit2gtk is already installed and available for discovery via the pkg-config command.
  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37 libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
  ```

  ```
  npm run build:webview
  cargo run -p conduit-webview
  ```

# Create Yew App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Yew App], if you want to quickly setup a new Yew web app for your own, you might try [Create Yew App], an unofficial tool to set up a modern Yew web app by simply running one command. 

```bash
npx create-yew-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
